      <speech0>Listen up: we don’t have much time so you need to get the hang of this gauntlet quickly. If you shoot at objects like elevator rails they’ll react to the electricity. Use the right mouse button to try it out.</speech0>
      <speech1>You also may need to use the glove to defend yourself. Use the left mouse button to generate an electric field that will neutralize enemy attacks.</speech1>
      <speech2>Oh, and remember that you'll need to be properly grounded to use the glove, so try not to jump too much.</speech2>
      <speech3>If you fall, the lampposts around the city will help guide you back. Make sure you turn on any you pass. The wiring is a bit temperamental, so only one lamp will light at a time.</speech3>
    </MirandaTutorial>
    <AtticusTutorial>
      <speech0>Fine work, Aliver. You learn quickly. It looks like we’re just about ready to go.</speech0>
      <speech1>Remember that anytime you feel like taking a break, you can open the pause menu by pressing "Esc".</speech1>
      <speech2>It looks like Miranda and Sullivan are ready to go. We'll be around if you need us!</speech2>
      <speech3>Get going!!</speech3>
    </AtticusTutorial>
	<SullivanTutorial>
    	<speech0>Hey Aliver! You want some more practice with that glove?</speech0>
    	<speech1>I've set up a training dummy over on your left. I lowered his power settings so he won't hurt you, but I wouldn't get too close to him.</speech1>
    	<speech2>You'll run into more security drones like that on your way to the airship, but they're a little more threatening.</speech2>
        <speech3>Make sure you always have your guard up.</speech3>
    </SullivanTutorial>
    <MirandaLevel1>
    	<speech0>Time is of the essence, Aliver. You need to get back to work.</speech0>
    	<speech1>Is the Airship ready? If it's not, you shouldn't be here talking to me. </speech1>
    	<speech2>I know this is a lot to deal with, but bear with us—there's a lot at stake here.</speech2>
   		<speech3>Stop stalling!</speech3>
    </MirandaLevel1>
    <AtticusLevel1>
    	<speech0>We'll answer more of your questions once we're on the airship.</speech0>
    	<speech1>This task should give you a chance to practice with the glove. You'll definitely need it.</speech1>
    	<speech2>Aliver, this probably isn't the best time to chit-chat.</speech2>
    	<speech3>I hope you didn't actually think we'd really remove your arm.</speech3>
    </AtticusLevel1>
    <SullivanLevel1>
    	<speech0>How's it going? The airship ready yet?</speech0>
    	<speech1>Are you finding the map helpful? you know, I don't typically draw things, but I think that this one is one of my best yet!</speech1>
    	<speech2>You know, if we pull this off we'll be heroes! How exciting is that?</speech2>
    	<speech3>You should probably get back to the whole release-the-airship thing…</speech3>
    </SullivanLevel1>
    <MirandaLevel2>
    	<speech0>Hey Aliver, this area seems to be structured somewhat like a maze, make sure you don't get lost!</speech0>
    	<speech1>Atticus and Sullivan are up ahead, hurry and catch up to them</speech1>
    	<speech2>I'll be right behind you.</speech2>
    	<speech3>Theres no time to waste!</speech3>

    <MirandaLevel3>
    	<speech0>Aliver! the glove is no use against that creature!</speech0>
    	<speech1>You're going to have to use bombs to defeat it!</speech1>
    	<speech2>See that blue rift over there? Shoot that to drop bombs.</speech2>
    	<speech3>Try shooting different parts of it to drop bombs in different locations, if you hit it with enough bombs, it's sure to fall!</speech3>
