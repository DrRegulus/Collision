      <speech0>Hey there, Aliver! Time to test out your gauntlet. Try shooting at objects in the environment using your right mouse button to see if they react to the electricty.</speech0>
      <speech1>You can also engage in close combat using the left mouse button. Go ahead and try it!</speech1>
      <speech2>Looks good! Now let's see if you can find Atticus and Sullivan over east from here.</speech2>
      <speech3>Oh! And if you fall down, we've set up some handy lamp posts to guide you back. Unfortunately, the tempermental wiring only lets you light one at a time, so make sure you get close enough to turn it on!</speech3>

      <speech0>Fine work, Aliver! It looks like we're just about ready to go.</speech0>
      <speech1>...or maybe not...</speech1>
      <speech2>It looks like Sullivan still has some work to finish. It looks like you'll have to get out of here by using your menu. Press "Esc" and click the "Quit" button to finish this tutorial.</speech2>
